# Angular Composition API

A lightweight (3kb) library for writing functional Angular applications.

## Quick Start

> âš  This library is experimental. It relies on private Angular APIs and compiler workarounds
> that may break in future versions. Use at your own risk.

Install with NPM

```bash
npm install @mmuscat/angular-composition-api
```

Install with Yarn

```bash
yarn add @mmuscat/angular-composition-api
```

### Known Issues

The Angular compiler only discovers `@Input` or `@Output` metadata on properties that
can be statically resolved. Unfortunately this doesn't work with mixins, causing template binding
errors. A couple of workarounds are listed below.

<details>
    <summary>Trick the compiler</summary>
    
To work around this issue you can define a mixin that tricks the compiler into thinking
it's a static call. In your project, create a file with the following code:

```ts
import {decorate, State} from "@mmuscat/angular-composition-api";

export function State<T, U>(base: Type<T> & { create?: (base: T) => U}, _ = base = decorate(base)): State<T, U> {
    return base as any
}
```

Then use it in your application:

```ts
@Directive()
class Props {
    @Input() 
    count = Value(0)
    
    @Output() 
    countChange = Emitter<number>()

    @ContentChild(TemplateRef)
    content = Query<TemplateRef>()
    
    static create() {
        // etc...
    }
}

@Component()
export class MyComponent extends State(Props) {}
```

While this works, it could potentially break if the underlying compiler implementation changes.
Note that the mixin functions needs to be concrete, it can't be imported from a compiled library
or application (ie. imports from declaration files won't work).
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Slightly safer option</summary>

Same as above, except `inputs` and `outputs` are added to the `@Component` or `@Directive` metadata instead.
This doesn't fix the mixin problem, but it might help if the language service gives you issues.
You lose type inference on inputs though, which will be cast to `any`.

```ts
class Props {
    count = Value(0)
    countChange = Emitter<number>()
    
    @ContentChild(TemplateRef)
    content = Query<TemplateRef>()

    static create() {
        // etc...
    }
}

@Component({
    inputs: ["count"],
    outputs: ["countChange"]
})
export class MyComponent extends State(Props) {}
```
</details>

<details>
    <summary>IDE language service</summary>

If your IDE is complaining about types, either disable the inspection for input bindings (Jetbrains),
or use the second option above to suppress template errors.

VSCode should work fine with the latest updates.

## Example

### Application

State [Todo List](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-composition-api) on Stackblitz

### Component

```ts
// 1. Create props interface. 
@Directive()
class Props {
    @Input() count = Value(0) // Value<number> becomes `number`

    // 2. Create a factory function.
    static create({ count }: Props) {
        const setCount = set(count)
        const increment = Emitter()
        const disabled = Value(false)
        // b. Emit values to trigger state updates.
        Subscribe(increment, () => {
            if (disabled.value) return
            setCount(count.value + 1)
        })
        // c. Return values are merged with props. 
        return {
            disabled, // `Value<boolean>` becomes `boolean`
            increment // `EventEmitter<number>` becomes `(value: number) => void`
        }
    }
}

// 3. Extend component class with State.
@Component({
    selector: "app-counter",
    template: `
        <p>{{ count }}</p>
        <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
    `
})
export class Counter extends State(Props) {}
```

### Service

```ts
// 1. Create a factory function.
function loadTodosByUserId() {
    // a. Inject values from context
    const http = Inject(HttpClient)
    const emitter = Emitter()
    const value = Value()

    // b. Subscribe to values, cleanup is automatic.
    Subscribe(emitter, (userId) => {
        const source = http.get(`//example.com/api/v1/todo?userId=${userId}`)
        // Subscribe can be nested. It is cancelled each time a new value 
        // from the parent is received.
        Subscribe(source, set(value))
    })

    // c. Return values are public. Factories are *not* unwrapped.
    return [value, emitter]
}

// 2. Create an injectable service.
export const LoadTodosByUserId = Service(loadTodosByUserId, {
    providedIn: "root" // defaults to null
})

// 3. Inject service.
class Props {
    static create({userId}: Props) {
        const [todos, loadTodosByUserId] = Inject(LoadTodosByUserId)

        Subscribe(userId, loadTodosByUserId)

        return {
            todos
        }
    }
}

// 4. Provide local service if needed.
@Component({
    providers: [LoadTodosByUserId]
})
export class Todos extends State(Props) {}

// 5. Override provider if needed

const CustomProvider = {
    provide: LoadTodosByUserId,
    useClass: Service(factory)
}
```

## Api Reference

### Core

#### State

Creates a context-aware class from the provided base class. Inputs,
outputs, queries and other props are defined as fields on the base class. 
The static `create` method takes the instance of the base class as an
argument and returns a state object that is merged with the base class.
Reactive values created with `Value` are unwrapped. If returned
from the static `create` method, `Emitter` is unwrapped to a plain
function. Emitters in the base class are not unwrapped.

**Detach mode**

Components and directives with the `DETACHED` provider will have
their `ChangeDetectorRef` detached and will only trigger view updates 
when reactive state changes. In this mode:

- Variables assignment in templates is not propagated to reactive state (use events instead)
- Two-way bindings won't work (use events instead)
- `@HostBinding` will not work (use `HostBinding` in `create` or roll your own instead.)
- Static `@Input` values (eg. `count = 0`) will not trigger view updates (use `count = Value(0)` instead)

#### Service

Creates a context-aware, tree-shakable service from the provided factory function. If the
`providedIn` option is set to null, or omitted, you must provide the service in a `NgModule`,
`Directive` or `Component`. Start or retrieve the service with `Inject`.

#### Inject

Equivalent to `Injector.get(ProviderToken)`. Only works inside the context of a `State` or `Service`. Throws if called
outside a valid context.

#### Subscribe

Registers an effect in the current context. If `Subscribe` is called inside a `State`, the subscription is deferred
until the view has mounted. If it is called inside a `Service` or nested in another `Subscribe`, the subscription is
invoked immediately after the containing function has executed.

If called outside a valid context, creates a subscription which needs to be handled manually.

---

### Common

These APIs only work inside the context of a `State` or `Service`. Calling them at the wrong time may cause
a `CallContextError` to be thrown.

#### Value

Creates a `BehaviorSubject`. Optionally mirror an upstream `BehaviorSubject` if provided. Values are synced with the
view during the `ngDoCheck` lifecycle hook.

#### Query

Creates a `Value` that will receive a `ContentChild` or `ViewChild`. Pass `false` when used with dynamic `ViewChild` so
that it syncs correctly. Pass `true` for static queries.

#### QueryList

Creates a `QueryListSubject` that will receive `ContentChildren` or `ViewChildren`. Subscribes to the underlying query
list when it becomes available. Pass `false` when used with `ViewChildren` so that it syncs correctly.

#### Emitter

Creates an `EventEmitter`.

#### HostListener

Works like the `HostListener` decorator, returns an `Emitter` if an observer wasn't provided, otherwise it
will `Subscribe` to the observer and return the subscription.

#### HostBinding

Works like the `HostBinding` decorator, it will `Subscribe` to an `Observable` and use the `Renderer` to apply changes
to the property, attribute, class or style that was selected.

---

### Utils

#### get

Get the current value of a `Value`.

#### set

Sets a `Value` or triggers an `Emitter`, otherwise returns a function that will emit values passed to it.
