# Providers

When communicating between multiple components in a deeply nested component tree it is becomes impractical to pass
down state and bubble events using `inputs` and `outputs`, known as prop-drilling. Providers are a way to have shared
state across component boundaries.

Angular already has a powerful dependency injection system, but there are some limitations.

-  Providers must be provided statically, they cannot be set at runtime.
-  Reacting to changes in component state via a provider usually involves a lot of ceremony with one or more
   collaborating services or observables.

Angular Composition API makes it easier to define and consume values through a component's context by allowing
values to be provided during component creation. This is done by creating a `ValueToken`.


## Example

<Tabs defaultValue="parent">
  <TabItem value="parent" label="parent.component.ts">

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core"
import { provide, ValueToken, ViewDef } from "@mmuscat/angular-composition-api"

export const Count = new ValueToken<Value<number>>("Count")

function setup() {
   const count = use(0)

   provide(Count, count)

   return {
      count,
   }
}

@Component({
   inputs: ["count"],
   providers: [Count.Provider], // or viewProviders
})
export class Parent {}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="child" label="child.component.ts">

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core"
import { inject, ViewDef } from "@mmuscat/angular-composition-api"
import { Count } from "./parent.component"

function setup() {
   const count = inject(Count)

   subscribe(count, console.log)

   return {
      count,
   }
}

@Component()
export class Child {}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A `ValueToken` first needs to be added to the `providers` or `viewProviders` array of a component or directive. The
`ValueToken` can then be set inside the setup function of the component or directive it was provided in using the
`provide` function. This is particularly useful for sharing `Value` objects, which are not accessible outside of
`ViewDef`, but any value can be shared this way.

The value of a `ValueToken` is then retrieved using `inject`.

:::caution
The `provide` method can only be used with `ValueToken`.
:::

## Default Value

A default value for `ValueToken` can be set with the `factory` option. This factory supports dependency injection.

```ts
const Count = new ValueToken("Count", {
   factory() {
      return use(0)
   },
})
```
