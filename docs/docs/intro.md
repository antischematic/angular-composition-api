express components, directives and services in terms of functional reactive inputs and outputs.

## Features

-  Small bundle size (4kb min gzipped)
-  Minimal API
-  Granular change detection
-  Better-than `OnPush` performance
-  Optional Zone.js
-  Observable inputs and queries
-  Reactive two-way bindings
-  Composable components, directives and services
-  Composable providers
-  Composable subscriptions
-  Lifecycle hooks
-  Computed values
-  Automatic teardown
-  RxJS interop (v6 and v7)
-  Incrementally adoptable

## Project status

This project is currently in public beta. The API is relatively stable but some behaviors may change or be
clarified over time.
